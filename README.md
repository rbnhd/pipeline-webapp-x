# CI/CD Pipeline for example-voting-app (pipeline-webapp-x)

This repository contains the configuration and code for a CI/CD pipeline designed for the [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app), an open-source web application. The pipeline is built to run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and uses a range of technologies to achieve scalability, monitoring, logging, automation, service discovery, and security.

## Architecture

The pipeline uses the following key technologies:

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: The cloud provider used for hosting the application and the pipeline.
- **Terraform**: An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage the infrastructure on GCP.
- **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
- **Kubernetes (GKE)**: A container orchestration platform, used here via Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), to manage and automate the deployment of the Docker containers.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with the [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app). Please follow the link to understand the basic functionality and architecture of the application.

Instructions for setting up and deploying the CI/CD pipeline will be provided in the following sections.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account with necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- kubectl installed on your local machine.


## Files to prepare for local execution
* Store your variables in terraform.tfvars file. refer terraform.tfvars-SAMPLE for sample
* Create a service account key and store it locally. Set the credentials_file_path string to relative path of service account key in terraform.tfvars. Note that another way to authenticate terraform with Google Cloud is to use [User Application Default Credentials](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#running-terraform-on-your-workstation).
